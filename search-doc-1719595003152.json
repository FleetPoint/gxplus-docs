GX+ is designed to be more user-friendly and easier to use than Gen X, while also providing more customization options for bus owners. Some notable changes include:   Enriched customization optionsImproved performance (using new roblox programming techniques)Improved UINew Features Plugin SupportIncan support standard for all lightsEngine Stay-On capabilitiesRed override capabilities   warning GX+ is only designed and tested to work with Gen X buses. It is not guaranteed to work with other buses at this time, however you may try and do so (which will take a lot of converting stuff since there is no plugin for other bus types). Support will not be provided.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Installing the model​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Setup","url":"/gxplus-docs/docs/setup#installing-the-model","content":"  Import the gxplus.rbxm file into Roblox Studio, and take a look inside the model.   All you need to do is copy what is inside the model into the DriveSeat of your bus.   note There is a special Instance in there named Roll; if your bus already includes it, you don't need to copy it over.   Next, open up your GX+ Migration Plugin. Select the bus model. If the OK text shows up in red, you did something incorrect.   Otherwise, select Migrate to GX+ and everything should be good to go!   Check the studio logs to see if there was an error with migrating to GX+. If there was, let us know in the support channel in our discord server.   Check out the configuration options next!   warning GX+ was tested primarily on stock Gen X buses. This means that heavily modified buses with extra features may not work at all, and will likely need a plugin replacement for GX+. If your feature was just isolated in a single function, or is super easy to migrate to GX+, we will be happy to do that free of charge. Complicated features will require a commission.   warning With GX+, ALL lights besides the StepWell &amp; Marker lights are transparency based, instead of material based. This means, those lights, such as warning lights and turn signals, will need to have a duplicate part slightly offset, that should be named something like &quot;Backing&quot; with Transparency set to 0, and the Material set to SmoothPlastic. The light itself should have Transparency set to 1, and the Material set to Neon. The GX+ Migration Plugin does not do this for you since we aren't sure how your lights were previously setup if you did any modifications.   note Still need support?
