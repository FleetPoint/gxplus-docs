# Plugin Commissions
Want there to be a plugin that does something specific? You can commission us to make it for you!

## How it works
First, make a ticket in our discord server through the `/ticket create` command

:::note
The availability of commissions is based on the current workload of the developers. If we are too busy, we may not be able to take on your commission.

We will only work on up to 5 simple, 5 intermediate, and 3 advanced plugin commissions at a time. Check the product hub stock for commission availability.
:::

## Pricing
Due to the complexity of plugins, we have a tiered pricing system based on the complexity of the plugin.
| Tier | Price |
| ---- | ----- |
| Simple | 500 Robux |
| Intermediate | 850 Robux |
| Advanced | 1200 Robux |
