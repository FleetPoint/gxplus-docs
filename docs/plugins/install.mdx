# Install a Plugin

You can install a plugin by taking the module script, and just dropping it into the Plugins folder!

Refer to the plugin developer's documentation for more information on how to setup the plugin.

If you want to make a plugin, check out how to do that [here](/docs/category/create-a-plugin).

The plugins folder can be found in `DriveSeat` in your bus.
