# Intro
Today, you will follow along on how to make a plugin! This guide will cover the basics of making a plugin, and how to get started. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in our `#support` channel.

As an example, here's what a plugin might look like:
```lua
--!strict
local GXPlus = require(script.Parent.Parent.lib.include.node_modules["@gxplus"].types.dist.types)

type Preferences = {
	configOption1: string
}

local plugin: GXPlus.VehicleStatePlugin<Preferences> = {
	name = "Identifiable Plugin Name",
	invocationType = "vehicle_state_update",
	invocationContext = "server",
	overrideDefault = false,
	preferences = {
		configOption1: "Hello world!"
	},
	invoke = function(state, preferences, context)
		-- code goes here
	end,
}

return plugin
```

Let's break this down
- `name` is the name of the plugin
- `invocationType` is the type of event that will trigger the Plugin
   - `standalone` is a plugin that is not triggered by an event, but is instead called directly like a function
    - `vehicle_state_update` is triggered when the state of a vehicle changes
    - `player_enter` is triggered when a player enters a vehicle
    - `player_exit` is triggered when a player exits a vehicle
- `invocationContext` is the context in which the Plugin will be invoked (client or server)
:::note
Client-sided plugins are not currently supported
:::
- `overrideDefault` is whether or not the plugin will override the default behavior (applies to `player_enter` and `player_exit` events)
- `preferences` is a table of configuration options, it uses the `Preferences` type to help with correction and auto-complete
- `invoke` is the function that will be called when the plugin is invoked
:::note
All plugins besides `standalone` plugins also have an `initialize` plugin that is called when the plugin is loaded

It has the same parameters as `invoke`

## Type Support w/ luau
Plugins (and the `BusConfiguration` for that matter) use the `luau` type system. This means that you can use types to help with auto-complete and error checking.

This basically tells you what you can put for a certain option/property, and it will tell you if you put something wrong.
