# GX+ Docs

Let's discover **GX+ in less than 5 minutes**

## What is GX+?

GX+ is a replacement set of systems for Gen X buses, rewritten from the ground up to provide a more stable and feature-rich experience. GX+ is designed to be more user-friendly and easier to use than Gen X, while also providing more customization options for bus owners. Some notable changes include:
- Enriched customization options
- Improved performance (using new roblox programming techniques)
- Improved UI
- New Features
    - **[Plugin Support](/docs/plugins)**
    - Incan support standard for all lights
    - Engine Stay-On capabilities
    - Red override capabilities

:::warning
GX+ is only designed and tested to work with Gen X buses. It is not guaranteed to work with other buses at this time, however you may try and do so (which will take a lot of converting stuff since there is no plugin for other bus types).

Support will **not** be provided.
