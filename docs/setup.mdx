# Setup
## Downloading the model
Make sure you have purchased GX+, and have access to the FleetPoint discord server. You can download the model via the `/retrieve` command from Parcel.

## Installing the model
Import the gxplus.rbxm file into Roblox Studio, and take a look inside the model.

All you need to do is copy what is inside the model into the `DriveSeat` of your bus.
:::note
There is a special `Instance` in there named `Roll`; if your bus already includes it, you don't need to copy it over. 
:::

Next, open up your GX+ Migration Plugin. Select the bus model. If the `OK` text shows up in red, you did something incorrect.

Otherwise, select `Migrate to GX+` and everything should be good to go!

Check the studio logs to see if there was an error with migrating to GX+. If there was, let us know in the support channel in our discord server.

Check out the configuration options next!
